# Simple-Calculator�

A simple Java GUI calculator built with Swing. It performs basic arithmetic operations and calculates sine and cosine values in degrees.

# Features
- Two input fields for arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Trigonometric functions: `sin` and `cos` (in degrees)
- Clear button to reset inputs and results
- Error handling for invalid input and division by zero

#Purpose
This project is part of my journey to master Java and teach others through creative, visual tools. It blends logic with imagination—where numbers meet angles and buttons speak silently.

# How to Run
1. Save the file as `TrigCalculator.java`
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac TrigCalculator.java
   java TrigCalculator
